Library Information System (LIS)

***

**Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:**

- **Functional Requirements:**


  - Login: To Login Uses needs to Register First to LIS. Types Of Users: librarian,member,non-memeber
  
  - Any memeber can postpone the returning date if no booking has been made for that particular book.
  
  - With the help of LIS memeber can borrow or return book from there convient place.  

  - Non-memeber can only browse the books not borrow it for that you have to be member of the LIS.
  
  - Only Librarian has full control over the system , he can add or remove book from the system.

 
  
- **Non-functional requirements**

  - LIS system is website

  - It is made with HTML

  - The software LIS must run on institute LAN only

  - Security:
Only Librarian should have full control over the system so data can be protected.
 
  - Reliability:
The system should be such that it can be trusted upon considering that it has a huge amount of data.

  - Scalability:
The system must be able to expand its user base and take on more users as needed. The data should be scalable and stored in a database that is accessible from each library if there are many libraries. System should therefore be scalable.


**Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.**

- **Project Scope**

  - Planning:
Design should be realy quick in recognizing the sound and alret user as soon as possible.

  - Controlling:
First, we offer a simple system design. The design is then put into practise to create a real working system. Depending on the results, we might or might not take the changes into account.

  - Closing:
We compare our final system in-depth to the one we had originally intended to design.

- **Functional requirements:**

  - Recognizing high pich sounds.

  - Alert user on basis of information gathered from the sounds.

  - The Alert should be soon as possible there should be no or very less delay.

  - AI enabled with strong sense of recognizing the sounds of car horns, babies etc.

- **Non-functional requirements**

  - Reliability:
The system must be reliable in sending users alerts at the appropriate times.
 
  - Scalability:
Since around 5% of the world's population has hearing loss, we should try to scale the system to fit each person for their safety and security.

  - Performance:
The system should be highly effective in that it provides the user with precise alerts. Only when necessary, and not in response to every sound heard, the system should notify the user.

  - Security:
The personal data of system users should be protected.
